                    <p>Hello! My name is Regina and I have a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and recently completed a second degree in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. People love asking me why did I make such a big career change. During my Biochemistry degree, I had the opportunity to work in a Bioinformatics lab and that was what sparked my interest to learn more about Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>Did I dislike Biochemistry? No! My undergraduate work was even part of a paper published in a scientific journal

                    <p>I like that in computer science, I can still have my problem solving urges met but in a much shorter time frame. </p>
                    <p>I've had the opportunity to work as a co-op at 2 different startup companies where I've gained the ability to learn new skills quickly. I had a lot of fun as a developer and do not regret my career change.</p>
                    <p>My passions outside of coding include drawing, baking, and playing video games.  </p>
